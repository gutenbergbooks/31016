<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The books catalogued in the present volume were collected by the
Shakespearian scholar Edward Capell and formed the principal part of his
library during the years which he spent in the preparation of his
edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works. After the publication of this
his life's work and the completion of his commentary, the appearance of
which however was delayed, Capell parted with his library, the most
valuable portion being presented to Trinity while the remainder was
dispersed. The conclusion of the Seniority relating to the gift is
preserved in the books of the College under the date June 26, 1779. It
runs "Agreed by the Master and Seniors, that the thanks of the Society
be presented to Edward Capel, Esq. for the valuable Collection of the
old Editions of Shakespeare, and of the several manuscripts and printed
books, relating to the same Author. J. Peterborough, M.C." The further
conclusion relating to the keeping of the books will be found quoted in
the entry concerning the MS catalogue (p.<a href='#Page_163'>163</a>).</p>

<p>Edward Capell, son of the rector of Stanton in Suffolk, was born on June
11, 1713. He was educated at the grammar school of Bury St Edmunds and
at Catharine Hall, Cambridge. In 1737 he became deputy-inspector of
plays and in 1745 groom of the privy chamber; both appointments being
due to the patronage of the Duke of Grafton. In 1760 he published his
volume of 'Prolusions.' In 1768 appeared his edition of Shakespeare in
ten volumes, dedicated to the grandson of his former patron. The
commentary was not finally published till 1783. In the meanwhile Capell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>had died at his chambers in Brick Court in the Temple on February 24,
1781. He also published 'Two Tables elucidating the Sounds of Letters'
in 1749 and 'Reflections on the Originallity of Authours' in 1766.</p>

<p>The system on which the books have been catalogued will I think explain
itself. Each work is entered under the author's name whenever the
ascription can be made with a reasonable degree of certainty, whether or
not the name appears in the work itself. Otherwise books are entered
under their titles, except in the case of those published under
pseudonyms, which are treated as real names. Initials have not been
allowed as headings. In all cases in which any possibility of doubt
exists, cross references will be found in the index. With regard to
information concerning printers, etc. I have only given notes in cases
of particular interest. A list of printers and stationers will be found
at the end. In one detail I have deliberately sacrificed consistency to
expediency. I have, namely, in giving the names of authors of
commendatory verses and the like, followed the original or modernised
spelling as appeared more convenient in each individual case.</p>

<p>Finally it is my pleasant duty to acknowledge the kind and valuable help
I have throughout received from Mr Aldis Wright, at whose original
suggestion the present work was undertaken. I also owe certain
suggestions and corrections to my friend Mr A.W. Pollard of the British
Museum, to whom the proofs were submitted.</p>

general title is on A 2, followed by argument and personae to the
'Alexandrian Tragedy,' which begins on B 1. 'Julius Caesar' has a
separate titlepage with same imprint on P 2. The rest of the volume
(sig. a etc.) is the edition of the 'Monarchic Tragedies' of 1604
with omission of the first sheet, A. It begins with commendatory
verses by Robert Ayton, which are followed by the argument and
personae to 'Croesus' (some copies have four leaves to sheet a, the
additional matter being verses to King James). Then follows the
tragedy of 'Croesus' while 'Darius' has separate titlepage dated
1604. In the present copy the 1604 portion has been placed
immediately after sheet A of the new portion, in order to get the
plays in the order mentioned on the titlepage. This arrangement is
frequently met with but leads to absurdities, since the 1604
portion must either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> be placed, as here, between the personae to
the 'Alexandrian Tragedy' and the play itself, or else, as in the
copy in the British Museum, in the middle of sheet A.</p>

and the 'Iliad' instead of following the latter. The title-sheet
contains, engraved titlepage, with engraved portrait of the
translator on the verso; engraved memorial to Prince Henry on
second leaf. (In some copies the engraved titlepage is found
without the portrait on verso, and these seem to be the earlier
impressions.) This sheet takes the place of the original titlepage
(<i>c.</i> 1612-13) and the dedicatory verses to Sir Edward Philips
found in some copies of the original issue. Dedicatory verses to
Prince Henry, signed by the translator. Anagram on Prince Henry.
Verses to Queen Anne, signed. Verses to Viscounts Cranborne and
Rochester and Sir Edward Philips, occupying the two inserted leaves

The edition of the 'Odessey' had appeared in 1614, with an engraved
title 'Homer's Odysses. Translated according to y<sup>e</sup> Greeke. By Geo:
Chapman. Imprinted at London by Rich: Field, for Nathaniell
Butter'. This and the blank leaf preceding it have been cancelled
in the present as in most other copies of the collected edition. In
some copies, <i>e.g.</i> in that in the Cambridge University Library, is
found a printed titlepage: 'Homers Odesses. Translated According to
the Greeke. By George Chapman. [Motto.] London, Printed for
Nathaniel Butter'. Epistle dedicatory in verse and prose to Robert,
Earl of Somerset. Translations of Greek epigrams. Twenty-four books
of the 'Odessey' with a few verses at the end. The present which
was the first collected edition appeared about 1616. It seems to be
generally assumed that the collected edition of 1616 contained, not
the 1612-13 'Iliad', but a reprint. Copies in this state are found
in the Cambridge University Library and the British Museum (G.
8837). The reprint, however, which appears in these copies must be
of considerably later date, as is evident from the constant use of
'v' medially. It was probably printed about 1640. Two of the
woodcut figures used as head-pieces were so used (with the same
break in the St Francis) in a book printed, probably by T. Harper,
in 1641 (namely the reprint of 'The Devil is an Ass' found in some
copies of the second volume of Ben Jonson's works, <i>q.v.</i>).
Evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> the stock of the 'Iliad' gave out before the 'Odessey'
and the first part of the volume had in consequence to be
reprinted. Probably therefore the majority of copies of Chapman's
'Homer' described as being of the edition of 1616 were not in
reality issued till some twenty years later.</p>

contains nineteen legends; Part ii eight legends, besides
Sackville's 'Induction' to his legend of Buckingham. The original
edition of the 'Mirror' was printed by J. Wayland probably in 1554
or 1555 at the end of his edition of Lydgate's 'Falls of Princes'.
The publication was stayed and the title only has survived. The
first edition actually published was that of 1558, which contains
Part i only. The contributors to the collection were William
Baldwin (the editor), George Ferrers, Sir Thomas Chaloner,&mdash;&mdash;
Caryl, and John Skelton, in Part i; George Ferrers, Thomas
Sackville Earl of Dorset, Thomas Churchyard, Francis Segars, and
John Dolman, in Part ii; while nine legends are anonymous. For the
authorship of the individual legends, see Mr W. F. Trench's
dissertation on the 'Mirror' (1898): the ascriptions given in the
British Museum catalogue are mostly erroneous. In the later
editions initials were frequently placed at the end of the legends
to indicate the authorship, but in many cases they are wrong and in
all want authority.</p>

signed 3¶, 2a-2f<sup>6</sup>2g<sup>2</sup>2G<sup>6</sup>2h<sup>6</sup>2k-3b<sup>6</sup>, paged (irregularly
and in three portions, beginning respectively on A 1, a 1 and 2a 1,
in the last of which the numbering jumps from 156-257). Verses to
the reader signed B. I. facing title. Titlepage with portrait.
Epistle dedicatory to William Earl of Pembroke and Philip Earl of
Montgomery, signed by Iohn Heminge and Henry Condell. Address to
the readers, signed by the same. Commendatory verses signed Ben:
Ionson and Hugh Holland. Table of contents (which omits 'Troilus
and Cressida'). More commendatory verses signed L. Digges and I. M.
List of the principal actors. The three parts, comedies, histories,
and tragedies, have separate pagination and signatures. 'Troilus
and Cressida' which is inserted at the head of the tragedies, is
unpaged and occupies sigs. ¶-3¶ and the two unsigned leaves
preceding them. The arrangement of the preliminary matter offers
some difficulties. The only leaves signed are the third and fourth,
<i>A</i> 2 and <i>A</i> 3, containing the epistle dedicatory and the address
to the readers. The fifth leaf, containing Jonson's verses,
certainly forms one sheet with <i>A</i> 3; and in the same way the sixth
leaf, containing Holland's verses, certainly forms one sheet with
<i>A</i> 2. It is further highly probable that the seventh leaf,
containing the table of contents, forms one sheet with the verses
signed B. I. <i>(A</i> 1), and that the titlepage is on a single leaf
inserted; also that leaves eight and nine, containing the further
commendatory verses and the list of actors, form one sheet
together. As the present copy shows no trace of ever having been
tampered with, the above arrangement is probably original. It
should however be noted that in the Chatsworth copy the unsigned
sheet here placed after quire <i>A</i> is there bound up in the middle.
This may be the correct arrangement, but the copy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> not in its
original state. In the Grylls copy the preliminary matter has been
rearranged. For the irregularities in the making up of the volume
and the variations presented by different copies see Mr. Sidney
Lee's Introduction to the Oxford Facsimile. The first collected
edition of Shakespeare's plays, in which twenty appeared for the
first time.</p>

Commendatory verses, two copies unsigned not in previous edition,
copies signed L. Digges and I. M. List of principal actors. More
commendatory verses signed Ben. Ionson, I. M. S. (not in previous
edition), and Hugh Holland, Table of contents including 'Troilus
and Cressida'. The three parts have separate pagination and
signatures and 'Troilus and Cressida' begins those of the
tragedies. The misprint in the signatures of the preliminary matter
is accounted for by the fact of the compositor having reprinted
that in the first folio, irrespective of the fact that the
titlepage is here included in the quire. In the present copy
sufficient room has not been allowed for the imposition of the
portrait which consequently covers some of the printing of the
titlepage. In some copies one of the other stationers' names
replaces Allot's in the imprint. But beyond this there were two
distinct settings up of the titlepage. Thus the Grylls copy differs
from the present in reading 'M<sup>r.</sup>' for 'M<sup>r</sup>.', 'Copies' for
'Coppies', 'sold at the signe' for 'sold at his shop at the signe',
and 'Blacke' for 'blacke'. There are also two settings of sig. A 5
in the preliminary matter, one having an ornamental initial 'S' at
the beginning of the first copy of verses, the other a factotum.

of Pembroke, signed. Printer's note. This first edition is
imperfect, breaking off in the middle of the third book. The
division into chapters and the arrangement of the verse was the
work of the 'ouer-seer of the print'. The edition seems probably to
have been printed from a corrected copy of the first portion of the
romance left by Sidney in the hands of Fulke Greville, afterwards
Lord Brooke (see Greville to Walsingham, August 23, 1586, in the
State Papers, quoted by O. Sommer in Introd. to facsimile edition,
1891). The remainder of the romance was made up by the Countess of
Pembroke from Sidney's loose papers, and published by Ponsonby in
1593. The rarity of the present edition suggests that the
publication of the complete work was intrusted to Ponsonby on
condition of his recalling the earlier issue. The 1590 edition
cannot be regarded as surreptitious, but there was an attempt at a
surreptitious edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> in 1586, of which Ponsonby gave warning to
Greville. This seems to be the only recorded copy having the
printer's name on the titlepage, which is otherwise printed from
the same setting up of the type. The text is identical, but slight
differences in the type seem to point to the present being the
earlier issue.</p>

The inserted sheet contains titlepage and dedication to Queen
Elizabeth. The 'Faery Queen' is the same edition as above (1611),
but has the date 1612 on the titlepage to Part <span class="smcap">II</span>; so also is sig.
¶ and the single quire A containing the 'Prosopopoia'. The
remainder is a very close reprint, the contents and collation being
identical. The separate titlepages have dates as follows (they are
all printed 'by H. L. for Mathew Lownes' except the first):
'Shepheards Calender' with imprint 'London, Printed by Bar: Alsop
for Iohn Harrison the elder, and are to bee solde at his shop at
the signe of the golden Anker in Pater Noster Row, 1617.'; 'Colin
Clout' undated, 'Prothalamion' etc. 1617. The peculiarities
observable in the various copies of the collected editions of 1611
and 1617 are best explained on the following hypothesis. On Sept.
3, 1604 W. Ponsonby assigned his right in both parts of the 'Faery
Queene' to S. Waterson, who on Nov. 5 in the same year passed it on
to M. Lownes, who published an edition in 1609. Two years later the
question of a collected edition of Spenser's works arose. Lownes
caused a complete edition to be printed, and at the same time
determined to use up the remaining copies of the 1609 'Faery
Queen'. Instead however of printing the new titlepage on A 1 he
caused a single sheet to be printed containing title and
dedication, which could be substituted for the 1609 title. A 1
consequently remained blank in the new edition as it is found in
the present copy, and the title-sheet was inserted after it. The
result of using up the 1609 edition was that the stock of some of
the additional matter in the 1611 edition was exhausted before the
stock of the 'Faery Queen'. In 1617 a new title-sheet was printed
and prefixed to the remainder stock, the additional pieces being
reprinted when necessary. Even now some of the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> copies of
1609 remained and were issued with the general title and additional
matter dated 1617. A copy in this state is in the Library. The
first part to run out was the fourth alphabet containing 'Colin
Clout' etc., which is always found reprinted in copies having the
1617 titlepage. Perhaps the next was the 'Prosopopoia' which is
found dated 1613 in the present copy, but which is undated in the
copy in the Cambridge University Library. This last-mentioned copy
however has the original edition of the 'Shepherds Calender' dated
1611, while the present copy has the reprint of 1617. How this came
to bear the imprint given above requires explanation. The editions
of the 'Calender' of 1581 to 1597 were all printed for John
Harrison the younger (<i>i.e.</i> John Harrison II) and he probably
objected when Lownes issued the work with his own name as publisher
in the collected edition of 1611. Before the reprint however was
required John Harrison the elder (<i>i.e.</i> John Harrison I) either
died or retired from business (1616), whereupon John Harrison II
assumed the style of 'the elder' to distinguish himself from a John
Harrison IV who had started business in 1603.</p>

Editions of Writers, prose-men &amp; verse-men; with a Variety of other

</p>

<blockquote><p>An alphabetical index to the books in the collection, in Capell's
own handwriting. At the end is inserted a leaf containing a list of
'Quarto's wanted' to complete the collection of Shakespearian
editions. Of this list thirty copies were privately printed by
Steevens in 1780, and it was also reprinted in Hartshorne's 'Book
Rarities of Cambridge' in 1829. The list is not very accurate and
there are many omissions. It inserts, moreover, as if in the
collection, many editions which it never contained, Capell having
intended to make the list of Shakespearian quartos complete by
reference to other collections when his own failed. In the inside
of the cover is the following inscription: 'June 26. 1779. Ordered
by the Master and Seniors, agreeably to the express Desire of M<sup>r</sup>.
Capel, that the whole Collection given by him be kept together in
the same Class; and that no Manuscript or Book belonging to it be
taken out of the Library on any Pretence whatever. J. Peterborough
M C.' There are also three documents inserted relating to articles
in the collection. One of these runs 'Effigies William Shakespeare
Britanni ad fidem tabellæ unicæ manu Richard Burbage depictæ (circa
annum, ut videtur, 1609) per R. Barret Londinensem quam exactissimè
expressa anno 1759, curantibus David Garrick et Edward Capell.
Capell's Collection given to y<sup>e</sup> College 1779'. Another is headed
'Extract of a letter to M<sup>r</sup>. Capell, that accompany'd a Cast from
the face of Shakespear's monument at Stratford, dated Dec<sup>r</sup>. 13.
1780.'. The portrait and cast are both in the Library. The third is
a list of certain books in Capell's handwriting. There has also
been added to the collection a fine medallion head of Capell,
engraved by Bartolozzi after a plaster model taken from life by
Roubilliac in 1750.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

MS. 3. The date at which Capell began and ended each play is
entered, but these dates do not run consecutively through the
volumes as finally bound up. The earliest date is that to the
'Merry Wives of Windsor', begun Nov. 25, 1749, and ended Jan. 18,
1750; the latest that to the 'Taming of the Shrew', begun July 4,
1766 and ended Aug. 1 of the same year. Whether these dates refer
to the actual construction of the text or merely to the present
transcript is not clear, but they certainly bear some relation to
the latter as may be seen from the handwriting which gradually
grows larger, heavier, and less easy to read, though always
distinguished by copperplate regularity.</p></blockquote>

the Restoration of Charles the second) so many as have been
printed, with their several Editions: faithfully compiled, and
digested in quite new Method, by E. C. With a Preface.'. This is
followed by a bibliographical appendix of titles, which was never
printed. The 'School of Shakespeare' was begun Feb. 3, 1767 and
ended Jan. 16, 1771. Part of the commentary was published in 1774
but was not well received and was recalled. The whole was then put
forth in three quarto vols. in 1779-1783, the last of which

in Capell's handwriting. The next leaf is B 1. The text has been
carefully corrected throughout by Capell, who has modernised the
spelling. The volume apparently contains Capell's material for an
edition of the Poems, which however were not included in his edition of
Shakespeare's works. The collection was published in 1709. On the
fly-leaf are the lines also in Capell's hand:</p>
